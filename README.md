# Data analysis on Witcher series

In this project, we are going to scrap the names of all the characters and extracting the relationship between the characters in the Witcher book series from the witcher wiki webside using selenium and some NLP library. And also apply some network analytics to transform thousands of pages into interative network graph for help us better understand the dynamics between the characters.
